# Chalenge 3 Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This redesigned portfolio, which now makes better use of the Bootstrap CSS Framework, showcases my web development journey and skills. It is a dynamic showcase of my projects and accomplishments, demonstrating both technical expertise and design insight. Designed to attract the interest of prospective employers, this portfolio showcases my progress in contemporary web development techniques.

### Motivation

The main motivation behind creating this portfolio is to present my expanding web development abilities in an approachable and polished manner. My goal with using Bootstrap has been to make a platform that showcases my expertise in an entertaining and responsive way.

### Specific Features

Bootstrap Integration: A responsive and mobile-first design is achieved by utilising Bootstrap, the most widely used HTML, CSS, and JS library worldwide.

Easy Navigation: The portfolio may be easily explored by visitors due to the Bootstrap-powered navigation bar. Every link leads to the appropriate part with simplicity, providing a user-friendly interface.

Hero Section: Features a jumbotron with my photo prominently shown, along with a short intro.

About Me Section: Provides an overview of my goals and professional path. For improved user experience and to maintain the page's clean, appealing look, it has been positioned apart from the Contact Section.

Dynamic Work Display: My projects are presented in a tidy and structured manner mainly to the Bootstrap cards that are used to organise the work area in a grid arrangement. This section effectively summarises each project, links to the related GitHub repository and includes placeholder photos and eye-catching cover screenshots from previous projects of mine. Additionally, employed placeholders from Placehold.co with customised colours to match the visual branding to improve the aesthetic appeal and preserve consistency.

Skills Overview: Provides viewers with an overview of the technical skills I'm learning during my bootcamp experience.

Contact Me Section: The purpose of the contact section is to make it simple to get in touch with prospective employers.

Stylized Footer: The footer gives the entire design a little of sophistication and interactivity by enhancing social media icons/buttons with hover effects and linking these to their respective destinations.

Minimal Use of Media Queries: The portfolio uses less custom media queries due to Bootstrap's responsive design features, which makes the code clearer and easier to maintain.
